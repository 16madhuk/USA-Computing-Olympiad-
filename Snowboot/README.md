Description: 
It's winter on the farm, and that means snow! There are N tiles on the path from the farmhouse to the barn, conveniently numbered 1…N, and tile i is covered in fi feet of snow.
In his farmhouse cellar, Farmer John has B pairs of boots, numbered 1…B. Some pairs are more heavy-duty than others, and some pairs are more agile than others.
In particular, pair i lets FJ step in snow at most s_i feet deep, and lets FJ move at most d_i forward in each step.

Farmer John starts off on tile 1 and must reach tile N to wake up the cows. Tile 1 is sheltered by the farmhouse roof, and tile N is sheltered by the barn roof, so neither of these tiles has any snow. 
Help Farmer John determine which pairs of snow boots will allow him to make the trek.
